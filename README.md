SPOTIFY DATA ANALYSIS USING MYSQL

This project involves analyzing a Spotify dataset with various attributes about tracks, albums, and artists using SQL. It covers an end-to-end process of normalizing a denormalized dataset, performing SQL queries of varying complexity (easy, medium, and advanced), and optimizing query performance. The primary goals of the project are to practice advanced SQL skills and generate valuable insights from the dataset.

-- create table
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS spotify;
CREATE TABLE spotify (
    artist VARCHAR(255),

Project Steps
1. Data Exploration
Before diving into SQL, it’s important to understand the dataset thoroughly. The dataset contains attributes such as:

Artist: The performer of the track.
Track: The name of the song.
Album: The album to which the track belongs.
Album_type: The type of album (e.g., single or album).
Various metrics such as danceability, energy, loudness, tempo, and more.
4. Querying the Data
After the data is inserted, various SQL queries can be written to explore and analyze the data. Queries are categorized into easy, medium, and advanced levels to help progressively develop SQL proficiency.

Easy Queries
Simple data retrieval, filtering, and basic aggregations.
Medium Queries
More complex queries involving grouping, aggregation functions, and joins.
Advanced Queries
Nested subqueries, window functions, CTEs, and performance optimization.
5. Query Optimization
In advanced stages, the focus shifts to improving query performance. Some optimization strategies include:

Indexing: Adding indexes on frequently queried columns.
Query Execution Plan: Using EXPLAIN ANALYZE to review and refine query performance.
15 Practice Questions

Easy Level
Retrieve the names of all tracks that have more than 1 billion streams.
List all albums along with their respective artists.
Get the total number of comments for tracks where licensed = TRUE.
Find all tracks that belong to the album type single.
Count the total number of tracks by each artist.

Medium Level
Calculate the average danceability of tracks in each album.
Find the top 5 tracks with the highest energy values.
List all tracks along with their views and likes where official_video = TRUE.
For each album, calculate the total views of all associated tracks.

Advanced Level
Find the top 3 most-viewed tracks for each artist using window functions.
Write a query to find tracks where the liveness score is above the average.
Use a WITH clause to calculate the difference between the highest and lowest energy values for tracks in each album.
